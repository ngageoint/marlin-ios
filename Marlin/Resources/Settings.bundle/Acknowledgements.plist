All source, data files and other contents of the PROJ package are 
available under the following terms.  Note that the PROJ 4.3 and earlier
was "public domain" as is common with US government work, but apparently
this is not a well defined legal term in many countries. Frank Warmerdam placed
everything under the following MIT style license because he believed it is
effectively the same as public domain, allowing anyone to use the code as
they wish, including making proprietary derivatives.

Initial PROJ 4.3 public domain code was put as Frank Warmerdam as copyright
holder, but he didn't mean to imply he did the work. Essentially all work was
done by Gerald Evenden.

Copyright information can be found in source files.
